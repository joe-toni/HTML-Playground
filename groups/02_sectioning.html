        <p id="intro" class="subject">As you might have read from the introduction HTML is an element driven language
            and while this gives us a number of elements we can chose from to work with, where we place them how we organize them 
            is realy important both for porper semantics and for referencing when looking for the items in a javascript file. Hence Sectioning
            tags or tags that are specifically made to make the separation of portions with some more generic than others. With some of the more specifically
            named ones usually reserved for commonly designated portions such as header, footer, or aside. In this area we will be going over some of these tags.
        </p>
        <p id="article" class="subject" data-content="<article>Independent article<article>">The article tag is one that specifies independent, self-contained content or content that makes sense on its own.
            It does not have any unique renduring or special attributes.
        </p>

        <p id="aside" class="subject" data-content="<aside>set this aside<aside>">Aside is the used to lable a portion of content seperate from the main portion. It's typically placed as a sidebar, and similarly
            to the article tag it has no special renduring but can be styled by name with CSS.
        </p>

        <p id="footer" class="subject" data-content="<footer>footers go at the bottom<footer>">The footer is similar to the footer of any normal document and is expected to contain information such as 
            authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, and other related documents. The footer can be included several times in a 
            document since it can be used for different portions some of which call for their own footers. 
        </p>

        <p id="div" class="subject" data-content="
        <div>this is a div with nothing  but text in it<div>">The &ltdiv&gt tag is a generic container meant to be used in a multitude of ways depending on the aim of the author.
            It has no special renduring unless specified through styling and can be the parent or child of most any other HTML element but is expected to be used only when no other semantic element is appropiate.
        </p>

        <p id="header" class="subject" data-content="<article>Independent article<article>">Headers are used as containers for introductory content such as headings, logos, or navigation links. A document can  have multiple 
            headers but should not be placed within footer, address, or other header tags.          
        </p>

        <p id="main" class="subject" data-content="<main>main content started<main>">A main tag is used to denote the main portion of a document and should be unique to a document and should avoid content that is 
            repeated across other documents.
        </p>

        <p id="nav" class="subject" data-content="<nav>this is a navigation link <nav>">The nav tag indicates the navigation portion of the document, while it does not contain all links for a page it 
            is expected to contain a collection of links to use for navigating the document, or to other related content.
        </p>

        <p id="section" class="subject" data-content="<section>random section<section>">Section is used to mark portions of a document that do not need special labeling but can or should be thought of
            as potions seperate from the other ones.
        </p>

        <p id="address" class="subject" data-content="<address>1515 made up ln<address>">Address defines a portion of the document dedicated to contact information about the author or owner of the 
            document. The contact infomation in a Address tag can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, and other such things. The text within 
            the Address tag will usually render in italic. It is not uncommon for an address tag to be used withing a footer.
