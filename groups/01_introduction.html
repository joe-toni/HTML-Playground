    <P id="intro" style="width: 40%; text-align:center; padding:50vh"> HTML is an element driven language, meaning that we build up our HTML by using sets of elements 
        each of which is meant to have more or less a specific function. I mention more all of these elments are nested within each other and 
        depending on how they are grouped, combined or used can affect how each one is used. but more about that later.
    </P>
    <p id="about" style="width: 40%; text-align:center; padding:50vh">The point of this site is to develop a space where a new learner might be able to scan through some of these elements 
        all while being able to test the actual code with real time renduring through the window provided below.
