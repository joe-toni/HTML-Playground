# HTML-Playground
## This Repository is a personal project meant for practicing HTML. The goal is to use predominantely HTML documents with either inline or internal styling/script to produce a vibrant site that showcases many of the capabilities of HTML, all while growing my familiarity with the language. As the page is added to or improved the README will be adjusted to better detail the contents.
## The site should now be delpoyed in its most basic state on git hub pages.
